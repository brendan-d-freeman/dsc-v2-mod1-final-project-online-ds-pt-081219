# Kings County Housing Price Linear Regression Project - Mod 1

## Overview

Here you'll find the work for my project for Flatiron's Mod 1 Final Project. Creating a linear regression to predict home prices in King's County. I used a number of technologies in my regression:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* MatPlotLib
* Seaborn
* Statsmodels
* Scipy Stats
* Scikit

## Data

You'll find the data used in my analysis in the file **kc_house_data.csv** that contains the price and information for 21,597 house listings from Kings County.

## Approach

You'll find the modeling approach and effort found within an iPython Notebook **KC_Linear_Regression.ipnyb**. To run this notebook, you'll need along with the packages listed above Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer to open and look at the notebook file. Once inside, you'll a documentation and details for each section of the project from importing the packages and data all the way to the final model. The notebook is meant to run sequentially from the top. So please ensure to run every cell accordingly and do not skip any or you will not get the proper output. There are no extraneous cells of code and each one is critical for the final result.

I used linear regression packages from Scikit along with ways to analyze the features for colinearity, R-values, p-values, etc. from Statsmodels and Scipy Stats.

Each section of the project is detailed within the notebook and commented.

## Summary Presentation

A presentation summarizing the findings of the model can also be found in the file **presentation.pdf** that can be shared with a nontechnical audience to communicate the results of the model. Anyone looking for a quick overview of the results without running the code can also find them there.
